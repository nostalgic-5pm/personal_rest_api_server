# 000 - Decision to Use Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The goal of this project is to learn how to create, maintain, and update a web app. To keep things organized and make the project sustainable, I want to document and manage the architecture decisions along the way.

## Considerations
I thought about this from a couple of angles:
・Do I really need ADRs for a solo project?
・Will it be too much of a hassle to keep them updated?

## Decision
I'm going to use Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

> Do I really need ADRs for personal projects?
→ I think so. Using ADRs should save me time in the long run and help me avoid repeating the same mistakes—kind of like the Groundhog Day anti-pattern I tend to fall into.

> Will it be a pain to update?
→ I'll only write ADRs when I feel it's actually needed.

The format of ADRs shall follow the format of this file.
The Status field must be either `Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`.
In principle, once an ADR is marked as `Accepted` or `Rejected`, it should not be updated further.
(However, minor updates such as typo corrections or clarifications may be made as exceptions.)

## Consequences
This helps me avoid the Groundhog Day anti-pattern.
